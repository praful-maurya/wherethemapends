            My stay at Vigyan Homestay was a heartwarming experience. The lovely hosts, Anna and Biju Bhai, 
            went above and beyond to ensure my comfort. They even helped me get to the location and graciously assisted with my backpack upon arrival. </br></br>
            The charm extended beyond the warm hospitality. A playful puppy (Sundari) with its 
            adorable litter of newborns and a curious kitten (Coco) added to the homestay's cozy atmosphere. For 2 days,
             I was treated to delicious homemade meals prepared by the host. They were also incredibly helpful in guiding me to 
             explore nearby locations, making my stay truly enriching. Vigyan Homestay offers a basic but comfortable room. The washroom 
             facilities are located outside the room, something to keep in mind when making your decision.</br></br>
            I experienced this at a budget-friendly price of Rs. 500 per day including breakfast and dinner (subject to change). </br> </br>
